Day 10 (two days later- 3/12/2003) while deploying Kuwait, the bumps on his right mid-thigh turned into an 'open lesion'. Medical placed him on a week of Prednisone and prescribed Atarax for the itching. By day 21 his rash was much better and resolving. However 2-3 days after completion of his Prednisone, his rash returned. He advised his SMPX site was crusty and weeping/oozing. Approximately 3-4 weeks post vaccination as transferred to Bagdad, he noted increased oozing to his fingers-hands, shoulders, hips, legs, arms and calves. He denied any problems with torso, back or his face. From June 2003-2007 he voiced 1 flare-up to his hands every 2-3 months. He knows of no triggers.

Her symptoms The patient filled out SF 600 Small Pox questionnaire and responded "yes" to several questions  and was sent to her provider for review.  The patient's medical record was reviewed during her visit. She has no previous encounters for eczema. There is no documentation of any previous atopic dermatitis in the patient's chart. Form was reviewed and it did not indicated any h/o of rashes, allergies, or medications used to treat any type of atopic dermatitis. When patient was interviewed, she reported that she had a h/o eczema. She stated that flare ups were limited and rare. She reported that she has not had a rash of any kind in over a year. She was not currently taking any meds for atopic dermatitis. She stated that she had used topical hydrocortisone cream in the past, however she stated that she had not used any steroid creams in over a year.  Her medication list was reviewed and showed that her last prescription for a steroid cream was in 2005 and it was prescribed for a facial rash. Physical exam was negative for rash, thickened skin, or any hypo/hyper pigmented skin. CBC was order to confirm normal WBC count. Pregnancy test was ordered to confirm that she was not pregnant. It was my understanding that she was deploying to a high risk area. I consulted another provider and was informed that atopic dermatitis is not an absolute contraindication to the vaccine and that patients with unclear, remote, or even limited histories are usually vaccinated. Based on the patient's chart/med review, history, and physical exam; I felt the patient to be a low risk for adverse reaction. Although people with a history of atopic dermatitis have a higher chance of adverse reactions to the vaccine, they also are at greater risk of dying from smallpox disease if exposed. I concluded that the benefit was greater than the risk. (The reviewing physician did consult with another provider for input in guiding her to make this decision). were mainly dermatological (pruritic erythematous papular and patchy  indurations, generalized including palmar and plantar areas, without mucosal involvement). There were no other systemic symptoms such as fever and/or malaise. Her vital signs were stable and she was not in distress. The member was given a prescription for oral antihistamine (cetirizine) as the treatment. Our conclusion, after a consultation with an expert who reviewed the photographs of the member's skin  lesions, is that it is an allergic dermatosis (induced by either vaccine  itself or the dressing material) and is NOT a case of eczema vaccinatum. The member and this provider had a discussion on clinical impression, course of treatment, duty restriction and expected prognosis. She will return to clinic for follow up.  3/18/09 MR received from reporter.  Seen 2/4/09 with c/o progressive rash all over body x 1 week.  Initially had localized rash at vaccine site with spreading lesions including palms and soles.  No mucosal involvement, but some genital itching. Went to local ER and was told rash was generalized vaccinia. Has had some loose stools x 3 days and external vaginal itching.  Numerous pruritic erythematous maculopapular indurative patches noted on PE. Injection site has dry crusted abscess surrounded by erythematous induration.  Assessment:  Smallpox vaccination reaction generalized. Also contact dermatitis from tape covering site. Consultant concluded not eczema vaccinatum probably a cutaneous allergic reaction.

The event occurred in May 2009. Review of related notes as well as phone interview indicated this 34 y/o male, developed fever, chills, malaise, loss of appetite, headache, sore throat, productive cough & mild shortness of breath onset approximately 10 days following receipt of small pox vaccine (SPV) given on 4/29/2009. This was the only vaccine received that day; however, on 4/23/2009 he received anthrax vaccine (AVA) dose #1, Hep B dose #1, influenza (IM), & typhoid vaccines. SM was initially seen in hospital 5/11/2009 for URI-type symptoms & gave history of prior intermittent chest congestion for 3 weeks; he was diagnosed with pharyngitis & prescribed Z-PACK, ZYRTEC & MUCINEX-D. That night he felt worse, spiked temperature, noted pain with swelling at SPV site left deltoid; he was taken to local civilian ER, diagnosed with left arm cellulitis & prescribed SEPTRA & Clindamycin. At medical center follow-up 5/12/2009 he had temp 101.7, small tender pustule in right axilla & right knee pain/swelling; he was placed on quarters & asked to continue antibiotic therapy. By 5/13, he felt worse & had developed scattered pustular lesions over scalp, right hip, left leg, & had increased right knee pain/swelling. On 5/13 he was admitted to hospital with presumptive diagnoses: right knee cellulitis & disseminated vaccinia. Initial assessment by Infectious Disease (ID) on 5/14 indicated overall clinical improvement, but continued right knee swelling/warmth without tenderness; blanchable red rash at SPV injection site (stable pustule), & over right knee; multiple scattered tense blisters, not excluding palms & soles: vesicles in various stages, characterized as yellow on erythematous base, umbilicated or ruptured, some becoming pustular, some with honey-colored crusts; distributed over scalp, neck, shoulders, axillae, upper extremities, trunk, buttocks, lower extremities. SM was diagnosed with 1) mild-moderate generalized vaccinia with clinical improvement although with new lesions within past 36 hrs; 2) hydrarthrosis right knee/tib/fib without overlying lesions secondary to reactive vs. possible septic joint, 3) leukopenia consistent with systemic viral infection - questionable prior episode with severe strep throat but no evidence of immune compromise, 4) normocytic anemia with low MCV/wide RDW suggestive of iron deficiency vs. hemolytic anemia related to vaccinia, 5) thrombocytopenia possibly related to vaccinia, unable to confirm if preexisting; splenic sequestration or ITP considered. Treatment with VIG considered if symptoms worsened. SM continued on IV Clindamycin with close monitoring. He continued to improve clinically & was discharged a couple of days later. On 5/27, at his first outpatient follow-up post hospitalization, he was well, back to baseline except for slight reduced exercise capacity. The SPV left deltoid was scabbed; all other skin lesions were resolved without scarring (except over right wrist biopsy site); right knee symptoms resolved; vaccinia felt to be clinically resolved, but concern for possible mild immunodeficiency state that predisposed him to vaccinia (old CBC from 10/2007 indicated similarly low values for WBC, Hgb/Hct, & Plt counts). SM was referred to Hematology at hospital on 6/12/2009. By then, CBC showed WBC 4.7, Hgb 12.8, Plt 89, MCV 89, normal diff; diagnosis was pancytopenia - resolved & probably due to viral illness. He was advised to have monthly CBCs until normal or Plt ct at least >100, Hgb >13; If CBC did not return to normal or worsened, he should be re-evaluated by hematology. SM was cleared to deploy.   7/2/09 Received medical records.

Neuro and musculoskeletal exams were intact with normal reflexes and without weakness. He was diagnosed with "axillary lymphadenopathy and allergic reaction to anthrax vaccine". No further AVA vaccine was recommended. Over the next week (Oct 6-12) he was unable to work. He complained of increasing weight gain ("201?218" lbs), bilateral shoulder, arm, hip, knee pain, body aches, localized red skin, fatigue, headache, and lymph node swelling (left groin, axillary, anterior cervical). He described his joint pain as a dull aching throb with stiffness that worsened with activity. Headaches were a dull tension starting in his neck radiating up over head to eyes (2-3/10). He self treated with ALEVE or TYLENOL with variable relief. He had intermittent red spots to posterior arms, neck, scalp line, back, hips that were nonpruritic, elicited a burning sensation, and were warm to touch. These red spots would come and go (duration hours-days) and were typically present when his joints hurt (but not always) and were not over the joints. He also complained of difficulty sleeping due to physical discomfort. He was eating less, had good fluid intake, and had loose stools 1-3/days (not diarrhea) with left lower abdominal pain. He was seen on 12 Oct 2008. Providers documented BP 138/100, T 98.5 HR 74 RR 18 WT 218 lbs (99.2 kg). There was a 4 cm node to left axilla and bilateral small lymphadenopathy to inguinal area. Thyroid was mildly enlarged. Labs included elev TSH 4.87 (0.27-4.20) otherwise normal ESR, FT4, CBC w/diff, GFR, CKMB, and SMA-7. Treatment included IV TORADOL with minimal relief. He was diagnosed with malaise, vaccine adverse event and lymphadenopathy. By week 3 post vaccination he felt almost normal noting a gradual improvement of symptoms.

The Food and Drug Administration then requested that I forward my military vaccination records to you. Enclosed is a copy (front and back) of my original military vaccination record and on the bottom of the copy, I included an interpretation and timeline of said vaccines. These vaccinations were administered to me over an 18 month period, beginning in May of 1966 and ending November of 1967. I was 19 years of age when I got the first of these vaccines, eight in the first month alone. To my knowledge, no other person was given these additional vaccines, and in my opinion, I feel as though I was singled out, possibly due to my blood type, which is B negative. Twelve more vaccines were administered between October 1966 and November 1967. Since then, I've experienced headaches, fevers, sore throats, and muscle pains so severe that I've had difficulty ambulating or even getting out of bed. I now experience muscle pain on a consistent basis, have a very limited range of motion, and have difficulty breathing, although I have never been diagnosed with any respiratory condition such as asthma, COPD, or emphysema. The main issue seems to be muscular in nature. I was discharged out of the military in 1969 due to this condition, which they have labeled as Ankylosing Spondylitis Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, MRI's and X-rays I've been subjected to have neither shown nor proven that I've actually contracted this affliction. Currently, the agency does not acknowledge the existence of any of these vaccinations. My vaccination record was taken years ago and although I attempted to obtain it numerous times over the years by contacting every available agency I could think of, I was never able to acquire a copy of it. Then, roughly three years ago, the original vaccination record was sent to a former address of mine from an unknown source and eventually, it was forwarded to me. I am currently sixty three years of age and have been suffering these same symptoms since the vaccinations were given. Prior to these vaccines, I was in excellent health, and was quite active on my high school track squad, at one point being considered among the top participants in my events. In the military, I again was a member of the track team, but by the end of 1966, I was unable to participate due to my "condition". I feel as though these vaccines have caused by current condition, and have reduced the quality of my life that time until now. At this point, I would just like to know what complications or damage may have either occurred, or may occur as a direct result of being subjected to a shot record like the one I have. I am quite concerned with what I may be forced to deal with later in life, as well if my current symptoms will become more severe, and any information you can provided for me would be greatly appreciated. I may not be able to control what happens next, but at least knowing what may occur down the road might help me prepare for it. Thank you very much for your time, and feel free to contact me with any questions."

The chest pain was accompanied by dizziness, SOB and diaphoresis. The pt denied radiation of the pain, N or V. On 6/11/10 the pt experienced substernal and left sided chest pain (4/10; squeezing/pressure). The pt took 400mg on MOTRIN immediately and the pain resolved in about 45 minutes. The pt denied SOB, dizziness, diaphoresis, N or V. On 6/12/10 the pt noted about 5 inches of redness around the vaccination site, right axilla pain and swollen lymph nodes in the right axilla. On 6/13/10 the pt felt fatigued and he had an episode of chest pressure (3/10) across his upper chest (bilateral) with SOB; he took MOTRIN with improvement of his symptoms (1/10). Later in the evening he had a "burning" sensation in his chest. The pt took 400mg of MOTRIN without relief. The pain was not improved with positional change. After about 2 hours the "burning" increased and at that time the pt experienced SOB, diaphoresis, dizziness (no N or V). The pt decided to go to the ER. His EKG showed ST elevations in leads I, II and a VL; cardiac enzymes were elevated (Myoglobin 116 [0-98], CKMB 7.0 [0-4.0], Troponin I 2.01 [0.0-2]).
